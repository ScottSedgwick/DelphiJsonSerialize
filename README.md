# DelphiJsonSerialize
A JSON serialisation library to finely control the structure of the JSON generated from Delphi objects, interfaces and records.

I built this library so I could have plain old Delphi objects in my application, then stream them to valid REST/JSON to submit requests to online services.

There are some simple examples of how to use this library in the test suite.

I have used this library in my Rollbar API for Delphi (link will beinserted here when I have it up on Github).
